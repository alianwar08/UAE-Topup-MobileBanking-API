## UAE Top-Up Mobile Banking API

#### Overview

UAE Top-Up Mobile Banking API is a sophisticated backend solution designed for the online banking sector, specifically tailored to cater to the needs of underbanked employees in the UAE. This assigmnet is a part of FitTech’s initiative to provide financial inclusion services, enabling users to manage their top-up beneficiaries efficiently, explore various top-up options, and execute transactions seamlessly. This API integrates financial inclusivity with the efficiency and scalability of .NET Core, accentuated by asynchronous programming.

#### Requirements and Scope

The API offers a suite of functionalities designed for user convenience and financial control:
- Management of up to five active top-up beneficiaries per user.
- A diverse range of top-up options, from AED 5 to AED 100.
- Varied transaction limits based on user verification status, enhancing security.
- A monthly cap on top-up amounts, fostering responsible financial behavior.
- Dependency on available balance for transaction authorization.

#### Architecture and Design Patterns

The application embraces a multi-tiered architectural approach:
- **API Layer (ASP.NET Core Web API)**: Facilitates client-server communication through HTTP.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Processes and enforces business rules and validations.
- **Data Access Layer**: Utilizes Entity Framework Core for database interactions.
- **External Services**: Integrates with external systems for real-time balance updates and transactions.

Adopting the **Service Locator pattern** for dynamic dependency management, the design is further reinforced by **asynchronous programming**, ensuring efficient handling of concurrent requests.

#### Technology Stack

- **.NET Core**: Chosen for its cross-platform capabilities, performance, and modern architectural support.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Simplifies data access and manipulation.
- **ASP.NET Core Web API**: Ideal for crafting scalable web APIs.
- **SQL Server**: A dependable choice for scalable database management.
- **NUnit**: Provides a robust framework for comprehensive unit testing.


#### Assumptions and Considerations

These assumptions have guided the design and implementation of the Mobile Banking API, providing a framework for understanding decisions made during development and setting expectations for future enhancements or modifications.

- **User Authentication**: The API assumes that users are authenticated before interaction, although specific authentication mechanisms are not detailed within the project scope.

- **Beneficiary Uniqueness**: Each beneficiary is considered unique per user, identified potentially by a combination of nickname and phone number, or solely by phone number.

- **Concurrency Handling**: The project includes mechanisms to handle concurrent transactions, particularly important for balance updates and top-up processing.

- **Top-Up Transaction Atomicity**: It is assumed that top-up transactions are atomic, ensuring complete success or failure without partial state changes.

- **Rate Limiting and API Security**: Basic rate limiting and security measures are assumed to be in place to safeguard against abuse, although specifics like API throttling and DDoS protection are not explicitly covered.

- **User Balance Management**: Interaction with an external service for real-time user balance management is assumed, allowing for balance checks and updates.

- **Data Validation and Sanitization**: There is an implicit assumption that all user inputs undergo validation and data sanitization to prevent common security vulnerabilities.

- **API Error Handling**: A standardized error handling approach in the API is assumed, ensuring uniform error response formats.

- **Database Schema and Relationships**: The database schema and relationships are assumed to be normalized with appropriate indexing and constraints for data integrity and performance optimization.

- **Logging and Monitoring**: The project is presumed to include basic logging of API requests and errors for effective monitoring and debugging.

- **Time Zone Handling**: All date and time calculations are assumed to be based on a specific time zone, likely the local time zone of the UAE or UTC.

- **Beneficiary Inactivity Rules**: There are no explicit rules assumed regarding the inactivity or deletion of beneficiaries, with beneficiaries remaining active unless removed by the user.

- **API Pagination and Data Limits**: Given the specified maximum number of beneficiaries and transactions, pagination or data limits for beneficiary listings or transaction history are not deemed necessary.


#### NUnit Test Scenarios

##### Verified User Transaction Tests

1. **Over Balance Failure Test (`Test000_Verified_OverBalance_Fail`)**:
   - **Scenario**: Verifies that a top-up transaction for a verified user fails when the user's balance is insufficient.
   - **Amount**: AED 100 attempted with an available balance of only AED 10.
   - **Expectation**: Transaction should be declined due to insufficient funds.

2. **Under Balance and Limit Success Test (`Test001_Verified_UnderBalanceUnderLimit_Success`)**:
   - **Scenario**: Checks successful transaction processing for a verified user within their available balance and monthly limit.
   - **Amount**: AED 100 top-up attempted with an available balance of AED 4000.
   - **Expectation**: Transaction should be successful as it's within the user's balance and monthly limit.

3. **Over Individual Monthly Limit Failure Test (`Test002_Verified_OverIndividualMonthlyLimit_Fail`)**:
   - **Scenario**: Ensures that cumulative top-up transactions for a verified user do not exceed the monthly limit per beneficiary.
   - **Amounts**: Multiple transactions totaling over AED 1000 (e.g., five AED 100 transactions followed by one AED 75 and one AED 30 transaction) for a single beneficiary within a month.
   - **Expectation**: The final transaction(s) should fail, ensuring adherence to the monthly limit of AED 1000 per beneficiary.

##### Unverified User Transaction Tests

1. **Over Balance Failure Test (`Test000_UnVerified_OverBalance_Fail`)**:
   - **Scenario**: Similar to the verified user test but for an unverified user. Validates the transaction failure when the balance is low.
   - **Amount**: AED 100 attempted with an available balance of AED 10.
   - **Expectation**: Transaction should fail due to insufficient balance.

2. **Under Balance and Limit Success Test (`Test001_UnVerified_UnderBalanceUnderLimit_Success`)**:
   - **Scenario**: Checks transaction success for an unverified user within their lower balance and monthly limit.
   - **Amount**: AED 100 top-up attempted with an available balance of AED 4000.
   - **Expectation**: Transaction should be successful, falling within the unverified user's reduced limit.

3. **Over Individual Monthly Limit Failure Test (`Test002_UnVerified_OverIndividualMonthlyLimit_Fail`)**:
   - **Scenario**: Ensures the enforcement of a stricter monthly top-up limit for unverified users.
   - **Amounts**: Repeated transactions totaling over AED 500 for a single beneficiary within a month.
   - **Expectation**: Transactions exceeding the AED 500 limit should be declined, validating the strict limit for unverified users.

##### Beneficiary Management Tests

1. **Addition and Validation of Beneficiaries**:
   - **Scenario**: Tests adding up to 5 beneficiaries, ensuring correct validation for each addition. Includes checks for invalid data like excessively long nicknames or invalid phone numbers.
   - **Expectation**: Valid beneficiaries should be added successfully, while invalid additions should be declined.

##### Top-Up Options Tests

1. **Validation of Top-Up Options**:
   - **Scenario**: Tests the API's capability to display and process various predefined top-up options (AED 5, AED 10, AED 20, AED 30, AED 50, AED 75, AED 100).
   - **Expectation**: All options should be presented accurately, and the system should correctly process the selected top-up amounts.

#### Configuration

Configurations are pivotal for the application’s environment-specific settings:

- **API Configuration**: In `appsettings.json` within the `MobileBanking.API` project, this file includes crucial settings like database connection strings and external service URLs, dictating how the API interacts with other systems and databases.
- **NUnit Configuration**: Detailed in `appsettings.json` in the `MobileBanking.NUnit` project, these settings specify the configurations required for the NUnit test environment, including database connections and external service endpoints. These configurations ensure that the test environment is isolated from production, providing a safe sandbox for testing functionalities.

#### Asynchronous Programming

Incorporating asynchronous programming is key to the API’s responsive and efficient operation, particularly in handling operations like balance checks and top-up transactions, which require real-time data processing.

#### Conclusion

The Mobile Banking API exemplifies a modern approach to .NET Web API development. It blends asynchronous processing, rigorous testing, and a keen focus on user needs, culminating in a solution that is both scalable and maintainable, ready to meet the challenges of the dynamic digital banking sector.
